- Imme Ebert-Uphoff: Article on ML challenges from GEO data, basically based on Fig. 7 of the 2015 workshop report. Audience: Machine learning scientists. Topic: Typical properties of data sets in geosciences. Basically: Take the table in Fig. 7 and illustrate the properties using examples from report. Imme Ebert-Uphoff (lead), with Vipin Kumar, Hassan Ali Babaie, Anuj Karpatne, Sai Ravela. Goal is to describe several geo challenges and the ML research questions they raise. There is a draft, may be submitted to the SIAM workshop.
- Basil Tikoff: Longer IS-GEO overview for geoscientists, based on Figure 6 in the 2015 workshop report. Target Computers and Geosciences journal: Basil (lead), with Mary, Suzanne, Yolanda. Suzanne and Yolanda to create version 0 from the IS-GEO NSF report.
- Suzanne Pierce: Short IS-GEO overview for geosciences: Science Commentary article [other other publication venue like Nature Geoscience or GSA Today or EOS] potential impact for IS-GEO to societal issues - Paper to Geo community: What is possible from IS side? Educate geoscientists about capabilities provided by IS methods. Suzanne (lead), Mary, Basil. There is a draft.
- Imme Ebert-Uphoff: Author a paper on state of education for IS-GEO, including all the choices educators have to make, e.g. target groups (undergrad/grad/young career/mid career), depth (one course, degree, short courses, tutorials), target audience discipline (geo/intelligent systems). Potential format to get started (then add more info): Ebert-Uphoff et al. "[Preparing for the Next Century: The State of Mechatronics Education](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/3516/18386/00847096.pdf)", IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics, 2000. Imme (lead), Suzanne (2016 IS-GEO Summer Course), Victor, John Horel, Yolanda, Sai, Mary (inverse modeling), Suzanne (integrated modeling), Deana, Dan Fuka, Enrique, Hassan, Beth.
- Additional papers:
  - Possible paper for iEMSs focused on environmental modeling. Dan Fuka (lead), Yolanda, Suzanne.
  - paper on Lexithon exercise for AGU EOS Letters? -- we'll see tomorrow.
