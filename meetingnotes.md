DRF: Notes

**NOTES FROM THURSDAY**

**TOPIC: Takeaways from Monday**

Imme:

- IS people often consider that data is data and you apply a method to it. The geoscience community views their datasets through the lens of hypothesis and purpose, and pre-processing matters a lot. Pre-processing strongly depends on the question you want to answer.
- IS sees it as data, and data is equally.
  - Comments from Juan...regarding importance of aiding IS and Geo researchers' ability to understand the different research interests and stances
  - Vipinâ€¦ important point because there is a dichotomy between data driven in CS and hypothesis driven in geosciences (not always, but usually).Risk is that the IS output isn't relevant/useful because it's not well situated with GEO data context...have to take extra effort to find a mutually useful approach
  - Vipin..there are various physical sciences communities and then there are virtual sciences. There are artificial boundaries viewed within these domains, but the IS-GEO researcher can be both an effective scientist in either physical/virtual
  - Juan...doesn't matter what other groups 'call' us, we just practice and pursue strong research
  - Transcending the boundaries...we are trying to develop more generalizable and robust approaches that can be applied to other areas
  - Dan...therefore IS-GEO is not a new 'core' discipline it is a core focus on problem solving
  - Sai....in many respects it's similar to applied math (e.g. Operations Research), because they can apply generalizable approaches across problem cases, but as approaches have become more complex, they are beginning to specialize and focus on specific data types and problems...we are expanding **Computational Thinking within Domains**
  -
  -
- Vipin: How can we expedite the process of transferring knowledge from IS to geosciences - and vice versa?

Interdisciplinary Teamwork - Deanna Pennington. This talk is available in Github: [https://github.com/IS-GEO/Materials/blob/master/Talks/Pennington%20Interdisciplinary%20teamwork%20issues.pdf](https://github.com/IS-GEO/Materials/blob/master/Talks/Pennington%20Interdisciplinary%20teamwork%20issues.pdf)

- Team science - collaboration sometimes across disciplines to research a topic
- Current IS-GEO is multidisciplinary (individual goals under thematic umbrella) vs. interdisciplinary (single shared goal) and transdisciplinary (e.g. bioinformatics)
- Differences between multidisciplinary (starting point), interdisciplinary, transdisciplinary. We are looking to be interdisciplinary. To reach that point, we must identify relevant research problems.
- Everybody likes interdisciplinary research when it goes well. However, when it goes bad, it might be a disaster.
- It may take up to 3 years to figure out how to be productive. How can we make this process faster?
- Why is interdisciplinary collaboration difficult? Vocabulary, finding shared goals, time consuming, bad research problems, difficulties getting funding/publications, etc. There is evidence about this. It is not anecdotal.
- Strong leadership, communication, flexibility/adaptability and ability to learn are crucial for success.
- Research indicates someone's ability to learn is linked to mental models, which are mechanisms generated and built by every individual to handle knowledge.
- Experts generally have very rigid mental models that are difficult to modify, therefore intermediate experts such as postdoc and graduate students may do better connections between different areas, due to the flexibility of their mental models.
- Lateral learning problem: Iterate-\>Grasp-\>Reflect-\>Transform, connect, synthesize.
- It's important to reflect on the ideas after the discussion. The "Aha" moments. Try to capture the moments that sparked your interest.
- To facilitate the understanding of new knowledge, we must be able to communicate and teach our science in a way that requires the least minimal effort from our team collaborators.
- Pattern for success: Use examples that are close to the science that you want to make the connection to. Building these connections creates patterns that lead to emergence of synergistic research ideas, a shared vision and problem model.
- Yolanda: Myers-Briggs Personality type, see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs\_Type\_Indicator#Differences\_from\_Jung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator#Differences_from_Jung) , helps to understand personalities and understand interactions in meetings, etc., that they cause.
- Science moves forward by model-based reasoning. Someone proposes a model and someone other proposes another model against it.
- Do the links with the people sitting on the table, not something that could be useful for someone that is not there.
- Phobias in collaboration.
- Short term vs long term aims.

**CONFERENCE DISCUSSION**

**Or possibly a workshop series that moves conference to conference?**

Observations:

- This group is delving into deep discussions
- We do not see each other at meetings and it is rare to find a shared venue for the two groups
- Bringing about change will require engaging with younger researchers
- Finding opportunities to share approaches and perspectives

We will need to consider the different cultures and credit for research activities

- For example GEOs need 'credit' for peer-reviewed publications if possible: Could do a hybrid model that the publications for GEOs go to journals and the computer scientists submit to the conference
- Handling differences in IS people reviewing GEO papers or vice versa
- Another option would be to submit conference papers to a special issue in an existing journal (e.g. Earth Science Informatics or Computers and Geosciences) - comment that special issue once per year isn't enough to propel a community forward
  - Also there is the Dynamic Data Driven Environmental Sciences (DYDES??? - Sai?) - We could possibly model our own conference after this one or host a workshop at different conferences
  - One possible concern is that various venues have different traction, acceptance rates need to be about 20%....only goes to quality venues
- Journal first - doesn't offer the opportunity for interaction among participants as much as a conference/workshop
- For computer scientists the conference model with peer reviews is valuable, done in combination with a journal

Sponsorships

- Frequently conferences supported by professional societies, is there a sponsoring body

We will continue to discuss this topic. For now, it seems that we could pursue:

- A journal special issue
- A workshop at an IS conference - eg AAAI

## Imme's presentation

- Intellectual contribution model (GEO):
  - Necessary: must address important questions
  - Necessary: Well documented methods
- PLUS one of the following
  - New insights? YES
  - Better prediction? YES
  - New pattern with no insights?

Sai, David disagree on the last point. Enrique added that it may happen in physics, but no geophysics.

IS:

- Must contain a new method/algorithm. (Daniel: not in some conferences/journals)
- Evaluation: should be done quantitatively. What if there is no ground truth?

PLUS

- Better prediction (YES)
- Existing algorithm applied to new application, yielding to better results (NO)

Yulia: in statistics there is a replication problem.

Publishing: for geo people, conferences don't count. Journals take less in GEO than IS.

Cross-disciplinary outlets? [SAI TO ADD SOME OF THE ONES HE MENTIONED HERE]

Yulia: we need a better outreach to improve understanding. Why do taxpayers need to fund us?

**NOTES FROM FRIDAY**

Notes from Imme (longer version) available here:

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QSUjhgjAVYHw3Zl516eOmzh-MbhLY9QPhW\_B-HwHyuU/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QSUjhgjAVYHw3Zl516eOmzh-MbhLY9QPhW_B-HwHyuU/edit?usp=sharing)

Notes from Mariana (shorter version):

We must find a situation and data set that can function as both a case study and as a benchmark.

- Methane source detection - Dave T (ground truth)
- Vegetation response to onset of CA drought - Dave T (no ground truth)

- Detection of storms tied to climate change- Sai Ravela (ground truth available)

- Partitioning different processes that were responsible for the values it collected

- Simplified models for quantifying uncertainty and risk of surge storms to plan better for the future - Sai Ravela (ground truth available)
- Downscaling with uncertainty of resolution by using a circulation model at two resolutions fine and coarse), or use a specific event, and evaluate the distribution of change in error between both resolutions (given the relationship of variables at the specific scales) - Sai
- Simulation data for representative problems from the IS community (soft inverse problems to test inverse models): Imme
  - the Methane dataset, also unmixing of vegetation spectra - both proposed by Dave T
  - TOY problems in convective diffusion, 1. standard inverse problems 2. stochastic problems with probabilities and probability distribution, 3. Assistive modeling problems - Sai Ravela

Four main areas encompassed by the proposed case studies:

Inference from data,

inference from models output,

inference from data and models,

Learning models from data/Identifying processes.

Lead for this group: Imme

**Geo-Simulations (parametrizations, scales, integration of different models, etc.)**

- From IS: Jie Li, Sai Ravela, Katie Skinner, David R. Thompson, , Yolanda G.
- From GEO: Suzanne, Daniel Fuka

- Each group discusses common topics of interest and defines one or more of these based on individual's interest:
  - Short term prototyping efforts
  - Mid-term proposal-size activities
  - Long-term driving vision
- Each group should consider setting up an IS-GEO Working Group:
  - Identify lead(s)
  - Report to the larger group
  - Prepare a brief description to publicise on IS-GEO web site
  - Set up group telecons/webinars and involve students and others signed up to IS-GEO

What is each of us interested in:

- Emre: The effects of different scales on the output, e.g. not only spatial but also at temporal scales.

- Yolanda: Work with hydrologists, model integration, 1) need to define the scope, 2) then select the models, 3) perform the variable mapping, 4) data ingestion, 5) runtime coordination. Breakdowns fail at all stages.

![](RackMultipart20230721-1-7vxsaz_html_870f0b46c8e72bf4.jpg)

- Daniel Fuka: Currently applied modelling in several realms. Primarily coupling three atmospheric domains (historical measurements, future climate forecasting, and real time and short term weather forecasts) to surface eco-hydrological modeling systems. Coupling these coupled models to ocean and estuary systems models, including coral health, estuary health, etc.
- Suzanne: 10 dimensions for model integration described in this paper (open access): [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815214003600](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815214003600)
- Decision support session, AGU chaired by National Labs fellow.

![](RackMultipart20230721-1-7vxsaz_html_c0c92db54bfde5b3.jpg)

Katie: Interested in targeted sampling not necessarily to get observations where model is uncertain but to target areas where model actually fails. For example, going from coarse scales to microscales. Can we take target samples at this intersection to aid integration of different models?

Common areas of interest:

1. Actively seeking data to improve the modeling activity (linking to the sensor-based data collection and integration group, but not just being passive consumers of their output)
2. Accelerating data ingestion, calibration, and integration of models- tools to assist scientists with these processes (eg rescaling, finding data, mapping/coupling models)
3. Managing simulation results - capturing workflow, tracking provenance of many runs (eg 40K runs), characterizing simulations, repositories of select simulation products

Target GEO area mid- and long-term: human-natural model coupling

- Lots of reports describing this, it is also in the NSG GEO AC document
- Funding opportunities: FEWS programs, (eg NSF INFEWS), etc.
- Incredible levels of interest in the community
  - By GEO people not at this meeting
  - Texas Mesonet - statewide sensor networks (e.g. humidity and temperature) - meeting in a few days

Short-term GEO focus for initial prototyping/demonstrations: soil moisture and water runoff

- Understanding recharge of subsurface water systems
- Involves combining long-term weather (link with atmospheric) and short-term weather forecasts
- Merging models and observed data, which is of great interest
- The human side: human responses to flooding forecastings, or real-time farm planning, waste management

Short-term IS focus: TBD, but soil moisture and water problem covers all 3 aspects of simulations identified above by the group

Lead for the group: Daniel Fuka

**EDUCATION SESSION DISCUSSION NOTES**

Various courses are being taught by the IS-GEO community members (list from Imme)

Levels:

Undergraduate and Graduate students

Pahdraic - various opportunities, including:

- NRT training grant ML and Physical sciences, ~20 PhD students with co-advisors, team science component in proposal,
- NASA minority with Cal-State LA, encouraging students to go on to advanced research/study (running in August)
- Issues and problems - basic skills in computing not a given, different levels need to be careful not to lose people in math concepts, prerequisites, asymmetry in the student disciplines (e.g. computer science students go to internships, geos very interesting).
- PhD students teach short courses, grad students tend to engage first and then faculty get interested
- Use python and R and jupyter notebooks
- Sustainability - hard to maintain interest at department levels, not easy to resolve because happening on margins in departments and often depends on individual people
- Question: Can these courses, once designed, be taught later by others either lecturers or doctoral students? ...Answer: Probably possible to have other people teach...requires development of course curricula and materials by upper level researcher and then can be taught by others pretty easily because pretty intro to intermediate level material
- Question: are you happy to share classroom resources? Answer: Yes most of it is up on Githubâ€¦.Pahdraic - willing to share resources and materials

Sai - Two Courses at MIT

- Lots of good infromation about the two courses (see slides)
- These slides will be available online and can be linked to by the IS-GEO community
- Lecture level is aimed at enabling students to use techniques and helping them identify links between knowledge domains where ML draws on concepts from other areas.
